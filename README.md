The provided code is a C++ program that calculates and analyzes the annual profits of the fictional Flourish and Blotts Bookstore. Upon execution, the program prompts the user to input monthly profit figures for each of the twelve months. It validates that the entered profits are non-negative and accumulates the total profits for the year. The program also identifies the month with the highest and lowest profits and computes quarterly profits by summing the profits for three-month intervals. The results, including total yearly profits, average monthly profits, and detailed quarterly profits, are displayed on the screen and saved to a user-specified text file. Additionally, the program offers the option to rerun the analysis after completing one run. The code is structured with modular functions to handle different tasks, enhancing readability and maintainability.
